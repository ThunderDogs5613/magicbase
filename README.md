## How to deploy
1. Open a terminal/command prompt. How to guides on this are out of scope for this document.
2. [Install pyfrc](https://robotpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/pyfrc.html#install-pyfrc), if necessary. On Windows, basically just run `py -m pip install pyfrc`.
3. Install robotpy-ctre, if necessary: `pip install robotpy-ctre` on your dev machine. (TODO: find the docs to link to about this.)
4. Run `./robot.py deploy`
